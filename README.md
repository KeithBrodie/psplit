# psplit
Split &amp; Join Binary files

Unix/Linux has the split command to dice-up files.  The psplit and pjoin python utilities were created for Windows to carve up large files to be written to DVD into '.split.1', .split.2'... which are small enough to burn to a DVD.  pjoin glues them back together.
